## Getting Started
In order to successfully make it through this guide, a very basic level of coding knowledge is recommended. Alternatively, if you are willing to learn on the go that's also fine! If you have some familarity with excel formulas, visual basic, html or other languages it will be smooth sailing. You can always use AI services like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to assist you.

If you have never seen a line of code in your life and are absolutely not interested, then you might be out of luck for the zero cost blog. In this case, I'd recommend using one of the services below to begin your blogging journey (albiet at a slightly higher price point).

1. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
2. [WordPress (Hosted)](https://wordpress.com/)
3. [WordPress (Self-hosted)](https://wordpress.org/)
4. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)
5. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
6. [Medium](https://medium.com/)
7. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)

All up, getting through this guide and setting up a simple blog website should take about 30-60 minutes.

## Workflow Tools
#### GitHub
Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up. GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It's what we are going to use to manage and deploy our blog website. Also download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This will allow us to easily manage version control locally on our computer.

#### Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, highly customizable code editor developed by Microsoft for programming and web development. Download and install this so we can build and test our website.
