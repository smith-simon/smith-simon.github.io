## Getting started
In order to successfully make it through this guide, a very basic level of coding knowledge is recommended. Alternatively, if you are willing to learn on the go that's also fine! If you have some familarity with excel formulas, visual basic, html or other languages it will be smooth sailing. You can always use AI services like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to assist you.

If you have never seen a line of code in your life and are absolutely not interested, then you might be out of luck for the zero cost blog. In this case, I'd recommend using one of the services below to begin your blogging journey (albiet at a slightly higher price point).

>1. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
>2. [WordPress (Hosted)](https://wordpress.com/)
>3. [WordPress (Self-hosted)](https://wordpress.org/)
>4. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)
>5. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
>6. [Medium](https://medium.com/)
>7. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)

All up, getting through this guide and setting up a simple blog website should take about 30-60 minutes.

## Workflow tools
#### GitHub
Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up. GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It's what we are going to use to manage and deploy our blog website. Also download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). This will allow us to easily manage version control locally on our computer.

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, highly customizable code editor developed by Microsoft for programming and web development. Download and install this so we can build and test our website.

## Building the most simple website

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service from GitHub that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

#### Create a repository

From GitHub, [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new) named **username.github.io**, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub. This is where all your website content will be stored online.

#### Clone the repository to your computer

This is so we can make changes to our blog in our chosen code editor (Visual Studio Code) and preview changes to the website locally before committing them. To do this click the "Set up in Desktop" button. When the GitHub desktop app opens, save the project. You can use the default locations suggested by GitHub Desktop.

#### Create an index file
An "index.html" file is the primary entry point for a web browser to display the content of a website, written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

#### Commit and publish
